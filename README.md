## Technologies and Architecture

The app is built using modern technologies and follows the MVVM architecture, ensuring maintainable and scalable code.

- **WebKit**: WebKit is utilized to display movie trailers directly within the app, enhancing the user experience.

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: The app's architecture is based on MVVM, separating data handling, view rendering, and business logic for better code organization.

- **CocoaPods**: CocoaPods is employed for easy dependency management, enabling the integration of external libraries and tools.

- **UIKit and Autolayout**: The app's user interface is crafted using UIKit, and Autolayout ensures a consistent layout across different devices.
